# potrace-ts

A typescript port of [Potrace](http://potrace.sourceforge.net)

base on [potrace javascript version](https://github.com/kilobtye/potrace)

The name of the algorithm derives from the fact that it uses
polygons as an intermediate representation of images, there ara many other trace project, and I think vtrace[https://github.com/visioncortex/vtracer] is amazing project which could convert a png to svg with color very fast.
